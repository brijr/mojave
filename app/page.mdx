Welcome to this **Markdown** example document! Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, which then converts to structurally valid HTML.

## Headers (This is an H2)

Headers are created by adding one or more `#` before your header text. The number of `#` you use will determine the size of the header.

### This is an H3

This is a level 3 heading, which is often used for subsections within a major section or for smaller divisions within a document. It is smaller than the H2 heading but larger than the lower-level headings.

#### This is an H4

This is a level 4 heading, which is commonly used for sub-subsections or smaller divisions within a document. It is smaller than the H3 heading and is typically used for more granular organization of content.

## Emphasis

You can emphasize text with bold or italics.

- **Bold**: `**bold**`
- _Italics_: `*italics*`

## Lists

### Unordered List

- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Subitem 2.1
  - Subitem 2.2

### Ordered List

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

## Links

## Code

You can present code blocks using three backticks ``` or by indenting lines with four spaces.

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, Markdown!")
```

Inline code can be done with single backticks: `inline code`.

## Blockquotes

> Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text formatting syntax. Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats, but the original tool by the same name only supports HTML.

Thank you for exploring this Markdown starter!
